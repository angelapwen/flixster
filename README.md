### Notes
This portion of the project went much more smoothly for me as I had already gotten the AlamofireImage dependency added in the previous week. I was able to understand the logic behind the collection view as well as the movie details view better and felt much more comfortable with navigating in XCode.

### Notes
During the course of this project, I learned how to access an API of movies as well as display several such movies in a scrolling list on iOS. I ran into a significant challenge while using CocoaPods and adding my AlamofireImage dependency to my project. I ended up using Carthage to download Alamofire and AlamofireImage for this project.
