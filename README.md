### Notes
During the course of this project, I learned how to access an API of movies as well as display several such movies in a scrolling list on iOS. I ran into a significant challenge while using CocoaPods and adding my AlamofireImage dependency to my project. I ended up using Carthage to download Alamofire and AlamofireImage for this project.
